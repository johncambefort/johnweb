          <h3>History & Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            I began dancing my first semester at Middlebury. I took the
            Introduction to Dance class offered by the department and taught by
            Professor <a href="https://www.lidawinfield.com/">Lida Winfield</a>;
            I realized immediately how close and welcoming the dance community
            truly is, and fell in love with the art as well as the people.<br /><br />

            I particularly enjoy improvising in the space with other
            individuals. Improvisation is complex (and thus infinitely
            interesting) because it requires an incredibly complex balance
            between listening and acting, watching and jumping in, taking a step
            back while being fully present and engaged. Being receptive, opening
            your body's spatial senses and giving extreme attention to detail to
            what's going on in the room, all the while dancing and moving
            yourself, can be pretty tough to do right. Additionally, when you're
            improvising with others, you have to change your perspective from
            the self to the collective: it's not all about you and how well you
            can point your toe. Rather, it's about continuously asking yourself
            the question: what does this dance need right now? What is lacking?
            What is present? Is it getting boring and thus time to change it up?
            How can what this person is doing be played with, accentuated or
            supported? Should something new be initiated or introduced? At the
            core, I see dance improvisation as nothing more than play, which has
            all kinds of relationship & dynamics involved and requires some
            pretty decent interpersonal skills! I aim to never stop dancing and
            keep it up, even after college.<br /><br />

            Below are a series of works I've danced in and/or choreographed (see
            "In Plain Sight"). I hope you enjoy reading about this and, if this
            is of interest to you, watch them by clicking on the VOD link (when
            available). I've listed all the folks I can recall who are related
            to the dance pieces, however there are many individuals not
            mentioned who've contributed to these works, whether in the form of
            simple feedback or more extensive collaboration. Please enjoy!<br />

          <p>
            “In Plain Sight” was my first full-length, semester-long production.
            It explores a variety of human interactions in public and private
            spaces, as dancers recognize one another (or choose not to). With
            intimate gaze and powerful focus (I am extremely interested in what
            can be communicated simply using our eyes -- turns out, a whole
            lot!), the performers played and improvised creatively, displaying
            group dynamics and their own individual styles. This piece was
            unbelievably fun to create and dance. If I've learned anything in my
            time in the dance department here at Middlebury, it's that the
            creative process itself is as much fun and juicy as the performance.
            My mentor and Professor
            <a href="laureljenkins.com">Laurel Jenkins</a> advised the piece and
            taught the course which framed its production.<br />

            Spring 2018 - "House of God" by Deborah Leedy -

          <p>
            "House of God" was one of my first real introductions to group
            score-work. We learned to feel one another's movement quality and
            explored synchronicity, as shown in the first score in which we
            pause and resume collectively. As my dance professors would say,
            this type of task is one that requires "having eyes on the back of
            your head" and feeling out through your back (which, believe it or
            not, is certainly possible!). At the time, Deborah was interested in
            examining the different ways in which faith can move our bodies.
            While I do not currently consider myself an active believer of any
            specific branch of faith, I was raised a catholic (my parents would
            occasionally take me and my siblings to church on Sundays and for
            Christmas, and sought to teach us a few of the religion's values,
            which I am grateful for). During my time at Middlebury, I have found
            that faith can be expressed in many different ways. For myself,
            faith comes up in the acts we do everyday that have nothing to do
            with religion, and yet have everything to do with my value system
            and defining who I want to be. In any case, the piece is loosely
            based on a travelling narrative from the Book of Job.<br />
