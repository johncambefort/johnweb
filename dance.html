            "House of God" by Deborah Leedy - Spring 2018 -

          </h3>
          <p>
            "House of God" was one of my first real introductions to group
            score-work. We learned to feel one another's movement quality and
            explored synchronicity, as shown in the first score in which we
            pause and resume collectively. As my dance professors would say,
            this type of task is one that requires "having eyes on the back of
            your head" and feeling out through your back (which, believe it or
            not, is certainly possible!). At the time, Deborah was interested in
            examining the different ways in which faith can move our bodies.
            While I do not currently consider myself an active believer of any
            specific branch of faith, I was raised a catholic (my parents would
            occasionally take me and my siblings to church on Sundays and for
            Christmas, and sought to teach us a few of the religion's values,
            which I am grateful for). During my time at Middlebury, I have found
            that faith can be expressed in many different ways. For myself,
            faith comes up in the acts we do everyday that have nothing to do
            with religion, and yet have everything to do with my value system
            and defining who I want to be. In any case, the piece is loosely
            based on a travelling narrative from the Book of Job.<br />

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            I began dancing my first semester at Middlebury. I took the
            Introduction to Dance class offered by the department and taught by
            Professor <a href="https://www.lidawinfield.com/">Lida Winfield</a>.
            More here soon.
